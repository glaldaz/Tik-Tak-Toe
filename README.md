# Tik-Tak-Toe

## Description

This is a Tik Tac Toe game implemented in React. The game keeps track of who's turn it is and places the correct mark (X or O) accordingly in the clicked box. It will then ckeck to see if either player has won.

## How To Run

Run the standalone.html

## Future Improvements

- Make the background colors match the mark, so X will have one color and O will have another color.
- Make the buttons more applicable to the game.
- Make it so that only an empty square can be clicked.
- Make it so that squares cannot be clicked after the game is won.
- Implement AI to play against
